# HyperID Android Integration Example

This repository provides an example of integrating HyperID authorization web flows into an Android application.
The example demonstrates two common approaches for integration:

- WebView Integration: This approach involves embedding a WebView component within the Android application to handle the authorization process.
- External Browser Integration: This approach utilizes an external browser to handle the authorization flow.

The purpose of this example is to showcase how developers can seamlessly integrate HyperID authorization web flows into their Android applications. 
By following the provided code and instructions, you can gain insights into implementing secure and user-friendly authorization experiences within your own Android projects.
